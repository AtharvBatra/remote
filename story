there was a crow,
and he was thirsty,
and there was a pot infront of him filled with water,
his beak could not reach the pot so he threw a stone,
and the water rose up, he found more stones and kept
filling the pot so that his beak could reach the water,

when he went away to get the 
last stone,
a parrot drank it
with his 
straw.
